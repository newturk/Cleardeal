## 1. Data & Feature Brainstorming (1.5h)

### Data Sources Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **CRM System**: Lead source, company information, interaction history, deal stages
- **Website Analytics**: Page views, session duration, form submissions, content downloads
- **Email Marketing**: Open rates, click patterns, response times, unsubscribe behavior
- **Social Media**: LinkedIn profile completeness, company following, engagement metrics
- **Third-party Data**: Company size, industry classification, funding information

**Secondary Data Sources:**
- **Calendar Integration**: Meeting scheduling patterns, availability preferences
- **Document Interactions**: Proposal views, contract downloads, signature timing
- **Mobile App Usage**: App engagement, feature adoption, session frequency

### Predictive Feature Engineering

**Behavioral Features (Real-time):**
```
engagement_velocity = (email_opens + website_visits + form_submissions) / days_since_creation
response_latency = time_between_contact_and_first_response
interaction_frequency = touchpoints_count / days_active
content_consumption_score = weighted_sum(downloads, video_views, whitepaper_access)
```

**Demographic Features (Static):**
```
decision_maker_probability = f(job_title, company_size, department)
company_maturity_score = f(company_age, employee_count, funding_rounds)
industry_affinity = historical_conversion_rate_by_industry
geographic_opportunity = market_size * regional_conversion_rate
```

**Temporal Features (Dynamic):**
```
quarter_end_proximity = days_until_quarter_end / 90
seasonal_intent = seasonal_conversion_multiplier[month]
lead_age_decay = exp(-days_since_creation / 30)
time_of_day_preference = peak_interaction_hours_analysis
```

**Interaction Quality Features:**
```
meeting_attendance_rate = attended_meetings / scheduled_meetings
proposal_engagement = time_spent_on_proposals / proposal_count
objection_handling_score = objections_raised / objections_resolved
budget_discussion_depth = budget_mentions / total_interactions
```

## 2. Data Quality & Compliance (1.5h)

### Data Quality Challenges & Mitigations

**Challenge 1: Incomplete Lead Profiles**
- **Problem**: 35-50% of leads lack complete company or contact information
- **Business Impact**: Reduced model accuracy, missed high-value prospects
- **Technical Mitigation**:
  - Implement progressive profiling with smart defaults based on industry patterns
  - Use external data enrichment APIs (Clearbit, ZoomInfo) for missing fields
  - Create synthetic features from partial data using domain knowledge
  - Apply multiple imputation techniques for missing numerical values

**Challenge 2: Noisy Behavioral Signals**
- **Problem**: Website tracking inconsistencies, bot traffic, and attribution errors
- **Business Impact**: False positive engagement signals leading to poor lead prioritization
- **Technical Mitigation**:
  - Implement bot detection using user agent analysis and behavior patterns
  - Use session-based aggregation to reduce noise from single-page visits
  - Apply statistical outlier detection (IQR method) for engagement metrics
  - Implement data validation rules with automated flagging of suspicious patterns

### Compliance Framework

**DPDP Compliance Implementation:**
```
Data Localization:
- All PII stored in AWS Mumbai region (ap-south-1)
- Cross-region data transfer prohibited
- Encryption at rest using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys
- Regular compliance audits with automated reporting

Consent Management:
- Granular consent collection (email, website, phone, social)
- Easy opt-out mechanisms with immediate effect
- Consent expiration and renewal workflows
- Audit trail for all consent changes
```

**Data Privacy Controls:**
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect essential fields for scoring
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear documentation of data usage
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic deletion after 24 months
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with least privilege principle

## 3. Model Choice & Metrics (1.5h)

### Model Architecture Justification

**Gradient Boosted Trees (Primary Model):**
- **Handles Mixed Data Types**: Naturally processes numerical, categorical, and sparse features without extensive preprocessing
- **Feature Importance**: Provides interpretable feature rankings crucial for business stakeholder buy-in
- **Robust Performance**: Less sensitive to outliers and data quality issues common in sales environments
- **Fast Inference**: Sub-100ms prediction times suitable for real-time API responses
- **Non-linear Relationships**: Captures complex interactions between lead characteristics and intent

**LLM Refranker (Secondary Model):**
- **Contextual Understanding**: Processes unstructured data from email content, meeting notes, and CRM comments
- **Explainability**: Generates natural language explanations for predictions, improving sales team trust
- **Adaptability**: Incorporates new information without full model retraining
- **Business Alignment**: Provides insights that resonate with sales professionals' decision-making process

### Performance Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
1. **AUC-ROC (Target: 0.85+)**: Measures model's ability to distinguish between high and low-intent leads across all thresholds
2. **Precision at Top 20% (Target: 0.70+)**: Ensures high-quality leads in the top scoring tier for sales team prioritization

**Business Metrics:**
1. **Conversion Lift (Target: 2-3x)**: Increase in conversion rate for leads scored in top 20% vs. bottom 80%
2. **Time-to-Conversion Reduction (Target: 40%)**: Faster sales cycles for high-scored leads compared to historical averages

**Operational Metrics:**
- **API Response Time**: <300ms for 95th percentile
- **Model Drift Detection**: Alert within 24 hours of significant performance degradation

from redis import Redis
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()
redis_client = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

@app.post("/api/v1/score-lead")
async def score_lead(lead_data: LeadData, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Check cache first for recent scores
    cache_key = f"lead_score:{lead_data.lead_id}:{lead_data.timestamp}"
    cached_result = await redis_client.get(cache_key)
    
    if cached_result:
        return {"score": float(cached_result), "source": "cache", "latency_ms": 5}
    
    # Real-time feature engineering
    features = await feature_engineer_async(lead_data)
    
    # Model prediction with timeout
    try:
        score = await asyncio.wait_for(
            model_predict_async(features), 
            timeout=0.25  # 250ms timeout
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        # Fallback to cached model or default score
        score = await get_fallback_score(lead_data)
    
    # Cache result for 5 minutes
    await redis_client.setex(cache_key, 300, str(score))
    
    # Background task for analytics
    background_tasks.add_task(log_prediction, lead_data, score)
    
    return {
        "score": score,

    def __init__(self, reference_data, drift_threshold=0.05):
        self.reference_distribution = reference_data
        self.drift_threshold = drift_threshold
        self.alert_history = []
    
    def detect_feature_drift(self, current_data, feature_name):
        # Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distribution changes
        ks_statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(
            self.reference_distribution[feature_name], 
            current_data[feature_name]
        )
        
        if p_value < self.drift_threshold:
            self.trigger_alert(f"Feature drift detected: {feature_name}")
            return True
        return False
    
    def detect_covariate_shift(self, current_features):
        # Population Stability Index calculation
        psi = calculate_psi(self.reference_distribution, current_features)
        if psi > 0.25:  # Significant shift threshold
            self.trigger_alert("Covariate shift detected")
            return True
        return False
```

**Mechanism 2: Model Performance Degradation Monitoring**
```python
class ModelPerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, baseline_metrics):
        self.baseline_auc = baseline_metrics['auc']
        self.baseline_precision = baseline_metrics['precision']
        self.degradation_threshold = 0.05
    
    def monitor_performance(self, recent_predictions, actual_outcomes):
        current_auc = calculate_auc(recent_predictions, actual_outcomes)
        current_precision = calculate_precision(recent_predictions, actual_outcomes)
        
        auc_degradation = self.baseline_auc - current_auc
        precision_degradation = self.baseline_precision - current_precision
        
        if auc_degradation > self.degradation_threshold:
            self.trigger_model_retraining("AUC degradation detected")
        
        if precision_degradation > self.degradation_threshold:
            self.trigger_model_retraining("Precision degradation detected")
